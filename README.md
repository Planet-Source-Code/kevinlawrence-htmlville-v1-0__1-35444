### Description

This is a program I made with my group for my computer applications class. It is an HTML tutor, and it has such features as lessons, a code library, quizzes, a high score list, and an editor. It uses an Access Database to store usernames/passwords for the login, username/score for the high score board. New users can easily start a new account, the default account name is User/User. I hope you find this code useful :D
 
### More Info
 
I am hoping to continue developing this program, so hopefully I can keep releasing new versions.
